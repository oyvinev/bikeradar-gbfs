# Bike radar

Realtime view of GBFS (General Bikeshare Feed Specification) data in an interactive map using Folium, htmx and FastAPI.

## Usage

Run `docker compose up` - go to http://localhost:8000.

Interactive map will be available on http://localhost:8000. The map will auto-refresh every 60 seconds.

## Configure

The default GBFS system it displays data from is for [Oslo Bysykkel](https://oslobysykkel.no). To modify this, set GBFS_BASE_URL environment variable to an auto-discovery GBFS endpoint.

A list of available GBFS endpoints can be found [here](https://github.com/MobilityData/gbfs/blob/master/systems.csv)
